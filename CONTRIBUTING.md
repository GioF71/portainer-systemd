# Contributing to portainer-systemd

Thanks for your interest in this project. It is my goal to share what I have learned.

## Getting Started

You can find the open issues [here](https://github.com/GioF71/portainer-systemd/issues). 
The best way to contribute start with a new issue, with enough details to understand the problem (or the feature request) and to start working.

## Contributions

This project welcomes contributions from everyone.

Contributions should be made in the form of GitHub pull requests.

## Pull Request Checklist

- Branch from the master branch and, if needed, rebase to the current master
  branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with
  master you may be asked to rebase your changes.

- Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is
  correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests).
